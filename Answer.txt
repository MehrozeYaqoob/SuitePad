what problems you might face if the requests originating from the Webview are SSL encrypted (https), and how you can overcome them?

Well this should always be the case but in our case it won’t load the designated page. 
1 - We can either proceed (which is not good at all) via handler in onReceivedSslError method.
2 - We can ask user to either proceed or cancel through alert dialog
3 - For Android OS 9, we would have to add security config xml and define it in manifest
4 - To handle SSLHandShakeException we can use TrustManager to resolve trust issues of certificates from CA’s not yet trusted by Android
